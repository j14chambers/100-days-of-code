## Rules:
**CODING IS THE MAIN TASK.**

I set up my schedule to where majority of my time is spent coding.

1. Do a task for a minimum of a hour.

	The task must be related to web development.
2. Keep the challenge going. (Steak)

	Try not to skip any days. This challenge is made easy to not skip any days. Thus I am always working on something.
3. Track progress through a [log] (log.md), [blog], [tweets] and [Instagram].
