#### Task:
- HTML and CSS
- Add Hours into JavaScript code
- Write the function for the stop button
#### Notes:
- Hours does not work
- There is a delay in the seconds starting. I cannot get it to act right. I tried reversing seconds with minutes, but that does not work.
- Overall, it's done. The countdown needs to work for hours and the seconds need to countdown when the button is clicked.
