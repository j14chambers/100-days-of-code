# 100 Days of Code - Round 2


## Day 1: June 11, 2018
### Project: [Pomodoro Clock](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock)
#### Task:
- HTML and CSS
- Add Hours into JavaScript code
- Write the function for the stop button
#### Notes:
- Hours does not work
- There is a delay in the seconds starting. I cannot get it to act right. I tried reversing seconds with minutes, but that does not work.
- Overall, it's done. The countdown needs to work for hours and the seconds need to countdown when the button is clicked.
