# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the HTML and CSS for  Wikipedia Viewer for FCC.

**Thoughts:** My main struggle is withe the API for Wikipedia. When I try to request an API it fails or it won't return anything.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/Wikipedia%20Viewer)


## Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a previous Javascript code and push the results to HTML tags.

**Thoughts**: The javascript of the code was already written. I just had to add in the HTML and CSS. Then take the results of the Javascript code and put it into HTML tags. I used jquery for this. The hardest part was getting the text to appear when the 'enter' key was pressed.

**Link(s) to work**: [Reverse A String](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/JavaScript/reversestring)


## Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to complete Wikipdia Viewer/Started on new Site.

**Thoughts** I still don't understand why the JSON won't work for the wikipedia viewer. Everything else seems to but the request to Wikipedia. I moved on to Charitable Organization. I started on the HTML and decided to use Bootstrap on this site. FireFox crashed on me when I was working on the forms and the site won't load, so I am calling it a day here.

## Day 4: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Factorial & JQuery

**Thoughts** I added HTML and CSS to the [Factorial](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/blob/master/JavaScript/factorial.html), allowing a user to enter in a number and get the factorial. 
I learned how to reset(clear) the HTML from a certain tag.

## Day 5: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Factorial CSS and Navbar

**Thoughts** I added more content to the HTML by adding a sidebar menu. I have never did a sidebar before. I also added hover and active to the sidebar.

**Link(s) to work**: [Factorial](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/JavaScript/factoral)


## Day 6: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Wikipedia Viewer on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** It a really long time to get this to work. I believe the problem was in the HTML and not the JS.

**Link(s) to work**: [Wikipedia Viewer](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/Wikipedia%20Viewer)


## Day 7: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I start TwitchTV on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** This project is easlier than the last two. Already I have the API working and returning data. I have put the data into the HTML using JQuery.

**Link(s) to work**: [TwitchTV](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/Twitchtv)


## Day 8: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I start TwitchTV on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I need to figure out how to get the data to return for the correct channel. Right now if 1 channel is online the rest show that they are online.

## Day 9: January 12, 2018

## Day 10: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with TwitchTV on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Today I realized that the requirements were to show wheather FCC was online or offline and also I needed to show other channels that were streaming. Now I have to work on getting the live streaming channels to show when the page loads.

## Day 11: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am still struggling with TwitchTV.

**Thoughts** So now I may live it at showing just FCC channel as per the requirments. I also have to show channels that are streaming but I cannot get the URL to return a response.
