# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the HTML and CSS for  Wikipedia Viewer for FCC.

**Thoughts:** My main struggle is withe the API for Wikipedia. When I try to request an API it fails or it won't return anything.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/Wikipedia%20Viewer)


## Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a previous Javascript code and push the results to HTML tags.

**Thoughts**: The javascript of the code was already written. I just had to add in the HTML and CSS. Then take the results of the Javascript code and put it into HTML tags. I used jquery for this. The hardest part was getting the text to appear when the 'enter' key was pressed.

**Link(s) to work**: [Reverse A String](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/JavaScript/reversestring)


## Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to complete Wikipdia Viewer/Started on new Site.

**Thoughts** I still don't understand why the JSON won't work for the wikipedia viewer. Everything else seems to but the request to Wikipedia. I moved on to Charitable Organization. I started on the HTML and decided to use Bootstrap on this site. FireFox crashed on me when I was working on the forms and the site won't load, so I am calling it a day here.

## Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
