# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the HTML and CSS for  Wikipedia Viewer for FCC.

**Thoughts:** My main struggle is withe the API for Wikipedia. When I try to request an API it fails or it won't return anything.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](https://github.com/j14chambers/FCC-Projects/tree/master/Wikipedia%20Viewer)


## Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a previous Javascript code and push the results to HTML tags.

**Thoughts**: The javascript of the code was already written. I just had to add in the HTML and CSS. Then take the results of the Javascript code and put it into HTML tags. I used jquery for this. The hardest part was getting the text to appear when the 'enter' key was pressed.

## Day 3: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to complete Wikipdia Viewer/Started on new Site.

**Thoughts** I still don't understand why the JSON won't work for the wikipedia viewer. Everything else seems to but the request to Wikipedia. I moved on to Charitable Organization. I started on the HTML and decided to use Bootstrap on this site. FireFox crashed on me when I was working on the forms and the site won't load, so I am calling it a day here.

## Day 22: Februray 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Roman Numeral Converter

**Thoughts** At first this program seen impossible, but as I thought through the different parts of this program, it became easy. I broke this program into parts to make it easy on me. I started with the spliting the number up into single digits and from there I use if statements that would convert the digit into a roman numeral. then I join the roman numeral together.
I tested each part of the if statements to make sure that they worked. But at the end the 4 and 9 would not convert. I will see about this problem later.

**Today's Progress**: FCC Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts**: I started on this project. I started with thinking that I would need a way to work with time in javascript. Now I think that I just need to take the hours and minutes given and find a way to count that down by the seconds and minutes.
